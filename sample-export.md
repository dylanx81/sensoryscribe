```
The wind howled through the broken shutters. The old wooden door creaked ominously on its rusted hinges. She could smell her grandmother's lavender perfume lingering in the dusty air, even though grandmother had been dead for years.

## AI Feedback

Your horror writing effectively uses auditory elements to create atmosphere. The sound descriptions (howling wind, creaking door) work well to build tension. The olfactory detail of grandmother's perfume creates an unsettling juxtaposition with death. Consider adding more tactile sensations like temperature changes, rough textures, or physical discomfort to intensify the horror experience. Taste elements could include the metallic taste of fear or dry mouth from terror.
